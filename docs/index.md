I am a PhD student in Computer Science at LIP6 laboratory. My research focuses on fairness in AI applied to education (human learning). I studied AI at Paris-Saclay University where Isabelle Guyon was one of my professor and I did my research internship under the supervision of Hugo Jair Escalante, Isabelle Guyon and Marc Evrard. Prior to this, I was graduated as an engineer from Arts et Métiers (ENSAM).
